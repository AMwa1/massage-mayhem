        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>
            Massage Mayhem is a game where you massage people.
            <br/>
            The game works by giving you parts of the back to massage every 7 seconds. When you get a prompt to do so, click on the proper part of the back.
            <br/>
            Clicking on the correct part of the back will give you $4. This can be increased. See the Extra Muscular Fingers and Ambidextrous upgrades. Clicking on the wrong part will result in the client not being too happy.
            <br/>
            There are many upgrades you can purchase in this game that help you, sometimes at a small cost. Hover your mouse over the upgrade buttons at any time to get a description of the upgrade.
            <br/>
            If you get $-1000, you will lose the game.

        <h3>Robbery</h3>
        <p>
            In Massage Mayhem, there is a chance to be robbed every 5 minutes. It works as follows:
            <br/>
            The chance to be robbed starts out at 25%. This can be mitigated. See the Relocation upgrade.
            <br/>
            If you do get robbed, you lose half of your money. This can be mitigated. See the Security upgrade.
        </p>

        <h3>Upgrades</h3>

                <br/>
                If you own 5 or more of this upgrade, there will be a 10% chance each click that you injure your client. This will result in you losing $100.
            </p>

                After you get more than 8 Franchises, every 5 minutes there will be a 15% chance for a Franchisee Revolt to occur. When this happens, the user has the choice to either lose half of their Franchises, or to have each Franchise grant 10% less money per second.
